  It's probably a good idea to let WRUF run once every hour. To do this, add the following line to
  Crontab, replacing '1' with the appropriate number for the minutes (anything from 0 to 59 will
  do):
    1 * * * * DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/wruf run
  You have to include DISPLAY in order to let the script work from the crontab.
